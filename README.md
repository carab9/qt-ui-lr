# qt_ui_lr

Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework. This project reads in a co2 data in a CSV file, co2.csv, averages the monthly co2 values to annual averages, and then runs linear regression algorithm on annual co2 values vs years to calculate the slope and intercept of the linear regression line. The program then uses Qt UI to plot a scatter plot of annual co2 data and the linear regression line.

## Requirements

C++ and C++ libraries: iostream, fstream, vector, map, algorithm, numeric, regex, smart pointers, memory
Qt and Qt Creator, QtCharts: QChartView, QLineSeries, QScatterSeries, QValueAxis

## Technical Skills

QtWidgets, QApplication, QMainWindow and QtCharts for UI display, regular expressions to parse co2.csv (regex), smart pointers, STL containers such as vector, and map, a few functions in C++ algorithm, linear regression algorithm.
